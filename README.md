# TensorFlow Based Number Recognition for ID Tag Verification  

Term Project for CS 6045 - Advanced Algorithms.  

We used TensorFlow and Google Colab for training our model for object recognition of numbers (zero - nine). The python notebooks and other scripts for detecting ID number based off the TFLite model's recognition are included.  

Original training Colab file (with YouTube tutorial) can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/EdjeElectronics/TensorFlow-Lite-Object-Detection-on-Android-and-Raspberry-Pi/blob/master/Train_TFLite2_Object_Detction_Model.ipynb) (was modified for our purposes).

## Instructions  

The instructions for both Jupyter notebooks are included in the notebook itself.
